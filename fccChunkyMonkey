Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.

Here are some helpful links:

Array.prototype.push()
Array.prototype.slice()

code:

function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  var finArr = [];
  while (arr.length) {
     finArr.push(arr.splice(0, size));
  }
  return finArr;
}
